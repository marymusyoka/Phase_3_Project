# **Predicting Customer Churn in Telecommunications: A Data-Driven Approach to Enhancing Retention Strategies at SyriaTel**

## **Overview**

This project aims to predict customer churn for SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, using a binary classification model. The goal is to identify patterns and indicators that can predict whether a customer will stop doing business with SyriaTel. This can help the company develop targeted retention strategies.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project consists of 3333 entries and 21 columns, including various features related to customer account information and call metrics. Key features include:

**state:** Customer's state.

**account_length:** Length of the account.

**area_code:** Area code of the customer.

**phone_number:** Customer's phone number.

**international_plan:** Whether the customer has an international plan.

**voice_mail_plan:** Whether the customer has a voice mail plan.

**number_vmail_messages:** Number of voice mail messages.

Various call metrics such as total_day_minutes, total_eve_minutes, and total_night_minutes.

**churn:** Target variable indicating whether the customer has churned (boolean).

## **Methodology**

## The project involves the following steps:

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the data to understand key patterns and relationships.

**Model Training:** Training a classification model to predict churn using features from the dataset.

**Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Using GridSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters for the Decision Tree classifier.

## **Features**

**Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the data.

**Modeling:** Decision Tree classifier with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

**Performance Metrics:**

 Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

 ## **Project Objectives**

**Predict Customer Churn:** Develop a model to accurately predict whether a customer will churn based on their features and call metrics.

**Feature Analysis:** Identify key factors that influence customer churn.

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using various metrics and refine the model for improved accuracy.

## **Tools and Libraries**

**Python:** Programming language used for data analysis and modeling.

**Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.

**Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for building and evaluating models.
